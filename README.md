# Make-Your-Own-Roblox-Template
Simple basic sandbox code to help developers get started on creating their own imagination platform!

Be sure to edit the favicon and the name Imploxia in the code to whichever name you chose for your sandbox site.

I wish you good luck in making this creation. Make sure to remember that security is key and ensuring the protection for your users aswell. Don't be a douche...users dont like that.

Also anything you use with this code is an action of the individual using this public source code and does not reflect back to me or EnergyCrate in anyway



Have Fun!
